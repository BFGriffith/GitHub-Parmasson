This GitHub Pages site is a “librarian” repository to act as a conveniently catalogued and helpfully organizationally presented archival virtual “Library” (Quenya＝“Parmassë”) of assorted GitHub code repositories that seem idiosyncratically interesting to me or otherwise worthy of greater attention…
* It also makes a nice prototype for deploying an [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) site [on GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).

<p>If you have suggestions regarding awesome repositories to add to this site or cool ideas about what can be done with Astro, please feel free to contact B.F. Griffith on Twitter to suggest them:<br><a id="T_handle" href="https://twitter.com/BFGriffith" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">🐦Tweet @BFGriffith</a></p>
