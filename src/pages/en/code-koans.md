## Ruby koans
* [Ruby koans GitHub repository](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)
> “Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests.”

## JavaScript koans
* [JavaScript koans GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)
* double click on `KoansRunnner.html`
> “When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the Javascript language and functional programming in general.
> Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.js file. These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.”
